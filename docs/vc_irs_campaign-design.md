# IRS Campaign { #vc-irs-campaign }

IRS is a vector control intervention that consists in the application of a long-lasting, residual insecticide to potential vector resting surfaces (e.g. internal walls, eaves and ceilings of all houses, structures or domestic animal shelters). When vectors come to rest onto the sprayed surfaces, they absorb a lethal dose of insecticide and die.  Thus the mosquitoes are impeded from biting and transmitting the malaria parasite to people in the vicinity.
IRS can be implemented through campaigns where spray teams visit each household of the target area and spray all eligible structures in the household, provided they are granted permission by household owners.

## Event details

### New event registration

The event requires the reporting institution and the organization unit where the activity was carried out. Being a campaign taking place at the lowest level of reporting, the community itself and its households, the implementation needs to choose carefully the level of reporting in order to be able to analyze and identify correctly the campaign, while being able to integrate the results in the national routine HMIS.

| IRS-CR-003 Summary          | Summary of the campaigns                      | Pivot table |

Depending on the local availability of insecticides, it is suggested to have also a map to observe the geographical distribution of the sprayed products.
